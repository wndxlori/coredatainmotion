        <p>Have you tried to use Core Data in RubyMotion, only to get lost in the quagmire of simplistic or confusing examples, DSL's and gems?  </p>

<p>Have you been asking yourself questions like: </p>

<p>Is it really necessary to use XCode to create and manage CoreData models? (actually no) </p>

<p>How do relationships between models work in code anyway? (It's a chicken-and-egg problem) </p>

<p>How do you pre-load data into your CoreData store? (It's easy with the REPL)  </p>

<p>What the heck is an NSFetchedResultsController, and why do you need one? (hint - performance/memory) </p>

<p>Isn't there a gem for all this? (There are numerous options)</p>

<p>Well, Core Data in Motion has got you covered.  I went out and shaved that herd of yaks so you don't have to.  And now I'll be serving it up in nice uniformly stuffed pillow-shaped pieces, I mean chapters.</p>

<p>Core Data in Motion is a mini-ebook, tackling each of these problems head on, one chapter at a time, with a brief historical review of "the XCode/Obj-C way", and then providing a detailed, code-oriented solution using RubyMotion and the iOS SDK.  And after we've achieved that base-level understanding of how Core Data actually works, we'll review the available RubyMotion gems which may provide even simpler solutions, but you'll now be able to understand exactly which problems those gems solve for you, which problems they do not, and be confident that you've chosen the best option to solve your specific problems.</p>

<p>Core Data is hairy because it solves real problems - <a href="http://sealedabstract.com/code/you-should-use-core-data/">http://sealedabstract.com/code/you-should-use-core-data/</a> </p>

<p>If you are using RubyMotion to solve real problems, with a real data model, and complex data relationships, you need Core Data, and you need this book.  Sign up now for the advance notification list, and you will receive the first sample chapter, when it is completed <em>for free</em>.</p>
